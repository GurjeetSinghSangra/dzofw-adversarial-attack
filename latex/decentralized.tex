\subsection{Decentralized SGF FW Experiments}
To study the performance of Algorithm \ref{decentralized} we considered a portion of the MNIST test set made of 1000 samples. Each of the $M=10$ workers received 100 images, 10 for each class.
We then tuned the hyperparameter $m$ for the number of directions to be sampled in the I-RDSA scheme. The best value for which the lowest accuracy (approximatively 20\%) of LeNet-5 was reached is $m=35$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:accuracy}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=6cm]{accuracy.png}
	\caption{{\small This plot was obtained by running Algorithm \ref{decentralized} multiple times, while changing the value of the parameter $m$ (horizontal axis) from $5$ to $40$ by keeping all the other parameter fixed. The vertical axes indicates the values of the accuracy.}}
	\label{fig:accuracy}
\end{figure}

With the increasing of $m$, the running time becomes very large and for this reason we had to find a value for $m$ which returns a low accuracy with respect to a reasonable running time. We ended up with $m=15$, which is a good compromise between the previous ones, and we kept this value fixed for all the runs.\\
\indent In particular, we performed three different experiments, considering $T=20$, $T=50$ and $T=100$. As the number of queries increases, the pattern of the perturbation becomes clearer, and in Figure \ref{fig:decentralized_perturbations} we can see how the 3-shape perturbation becomes more evident for higher values of $T$.

\end{figure}

This behaviour is coherent with the decreasing of the accuracy reported in Table \ref{tab:decentralized}: to a lower accuracy corresponds a sharper pattern in the perturbation.

It is interesting to notice that with $T=20$ queries of Algorithm \ref{decentralized} the accuracy of LeNet-5 already decreases to 55,25\%.

In Figure \ref{fig:decentralized} is represented the perturbation of Figure \ref{fig:decentralized_perturbations} (c)
applied on an image from class 4. The perturbed images have been classified as 3, consistently with the 3-shape of the perturbation.

To have a yardstick, the predictions of LeNet-5 remain very precise (89.17\% of accuracy) when tested on the images perturbed with random noise (Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.3). Even though Figure \ref{fig:gaussian_noise} shows a very evident noise compared to the one of the adversarial example in the previous image, the network still classifies correctly the images perturbed with a Gaussian noise.

It is noteworthy the comparison between the attacks: the Gaussian perturbation spreads the noise randomly in the space, while the Decentralized SGF FW's adversarial perturbation is characterize by a clear pattern that covers the majority of the image space and allows to fool the network on most images.
